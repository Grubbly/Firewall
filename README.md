# Firewall
Multiplayer firewall visualization castle attack/defense game for UAF CSC firewall lab

## Premise
Two castles are joined by a bridge that stretches over a valley. The castle represents a LAN encompassing boxes with different operating systems (namely Linux flavors and Windows Servers). Each box represents a section of the castle's wall. For every invalid port that is open on an individual box, that section of the castle's wall is weakened. A non-secure box allows oponents from the other castle to build a bridge to the section of the wall that that non-secure box represents, which simulates a connection being made from one network to another. Teams gain points by correctly entering in the firewall rules to re-secure the boxes. These points are used to buy malware that effects the other team's castle. Malware opens ports, shuts off firewalls, and does other... bad things. Points can also be used to improve your castle's defenses. The game ends when a team destroys each section of the opposing team's castle wall.

## Important Concepts
You should be familiar with these concepts and what they mean in context with a network by the end of the lab:

|   Keyword  |                                                 Description                                                |                        Gamified Representation                        |
|:----------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     LAN    |                                             Local Area Network                                             |                           The entire castle                           |
|  Firewall  | The filter that dictates which ports and applications the computer can send and receive network traffic on |                      Sections of the castle wall                      |
|    Port    |                       A connection channel to a specific computer denoted by a number                      |              The strength of a section of the castle wall             |
| Connection |                     A link between two computers that allows them to share information                     |                        Bridges between castles                        |
|   Packet   |                A snippet of information that is sent by one computer and received by another               |                      Things crossing the bridges                      |
|   Malware  |               Insecure software that negatively impacts the security of a network or computer              | The things you spend your points on to make the other team do work :P |
|     Box    |                                    Slang used instead of saying computer                                   |                      Sections of the castle wall                      |
|    Nuke    |                                      Slang we use when a box is FUBAR                                      |                  Destroyed section of the castle wall                 |
